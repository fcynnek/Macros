<span style="font-size: 13px;" face="Arial">Thank you for your application to United Nations job opening<strong> #138142, Auditor, P3, in the Internal Audit Division (IAD) of the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) in peacekeeping missions / field locations</strong>.<br />
<br />
After review of your application to this position, you have been <strong>shortlisted for an online assessment exercise</strong>. The online assessment, UN Core Competencies &amp; Reasoning Skills Test, will be available during <strong>Monday, 1 February 2021, 9:00 AM (0900 New York time) until Wednesday, 3 February 2021, 9:00 AM (0900 New York time)</strong>.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
You will soon receive a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">separate</span> </strong>automated email from UN Assessments which will include the link to the testing platform and your credentials to access the website. You may need to check your junk/spam/&ldquo;other&rdquo; folder.<br />
<br />
<strong>If you do not already have access to the testing platform</strong> (if you have never completed an assessment on the platform prior), you may receive <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">two emails</span></strong> with your username and instructions on how to access the platform. Please read both emails carefully to ensure you are able to access the testing platform and the assessment. <strong>Note</strong>: the automated email will include today&rsquo;s date as the exam start date; while today is the first day that you can access the information in the testing platform, the test window opens on 1 February.<br />
<br />
We strongly encourage you to access the testing platform as soon as you receive the log-in information, to <strong>familiarize yourself with the website, assessment instructions, timing and format, sample questions</strong>, and technical support tips.<br />
<br />
Finally, <strong>please note</strong>: those successful in this first stage of the online assessment will be invited to the next stage of the assessment process, which is likely to consist of a written assessment to evaluate your knowledge of auditing (more details to be shared for those invited to that stage).<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
